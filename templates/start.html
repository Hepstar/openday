The Sympact
group from the University of Bristol is working in conjunction with
Guardian News Media to research the energy consumption of digital
newspaper offerings, such as the Guardian On-Line.

This exhibit consists of a survey and a demonstration.

The survey involves answering some general demographic questions and some
questions concerning the respondents understanding of the energy
consumed by digital newspaper distribution.

The demonstration allows the user to explore those energy consumption patterns.

Your participation in this survey is entirely voluntary therefore you do not have to answer any question you do not wish to answer, and there are no consequences should you decide not to complete the survey.

If so desired, is also possible to enjoy the demonstration without also completing the survey.

The demonstration takes between X and Y mins to explore.
The survey takes about  minutes to complete.

The data collected will be analysed at the University of Bristol and relevant
results shared both within the academic community and with the
Guardian News Group. <h2>All responses 		are anonymous and no personally identifiable information is requested
in this survey.  Consequently there will be no way to retrieve
specific individual responses once the survey is complete.</h2>
