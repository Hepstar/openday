		The Sympact
		group from the University of Bristol is working in conjunction with
		Guardian News Media to research the energy consumption of digital
		newspaper offerings, such as the Guardian On-Line.

		This exhibit consists of a survey and a demonstration.

		The survey	involves answering some general demographic questions and some
		questions concerning the respondents understanding of the energy
		consumed by digital newspaper distribution.
		
		The demonstration allows the user to explore those energy consumption patterns.
		
		Your participation in this survey is entirely voluntary therefore you do not have to answer any question you do not wish to answer, and there are no consequences should you decide not to complete the survey. 
		
		If so desired, is also possible to enjoy the demonstration without also completing the survey.

		The demonstration takes between X and Y mins to explore.
		The survey takes about  minutes to complete.
